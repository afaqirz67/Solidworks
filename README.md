## A little practice

This assignment includes using lofted cuts, revolves and sweeps. We were to sketch a hammerhead and we had the choice to make a handle for it or not. Same as the last assignment we used a tutorial that's in SolidWorks.

### Lessons Learned
I learned how to use lofted cuts, revolves and sweeps by doing this assignment. I had trouble with the Flex, but after playing with it for a while I figured out how it works.  

## Sweeps and Lofts
