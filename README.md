## A little practice
  
In this assignment, we were supposed to follow a tutorial provided by SolidWorks itself and have different parts done. One part included an assembly and part and the second one just included just one part.

### Lessons Learned
These were the first assignments of the year so kind of refreshed everything in my memory and the new skill I learned by doing this assignment was how to use Linear Pattern. It basically allows you to copy your drawn sketch multiple times in a specific pattern.



## Sweeps and Lofts

This assignment includes using lofted cuts, revolves and sweeps. We were to sketch a hammerhead and we had the choice to make a handle for it or not. Same as the last assignment we used a tutorial that's in SolidWorks.

### Lessons Learned
I learned how to use lofted cuts, revolves and sweeps by doing this assignment. I had trouble with the Flex, but after playing with it for a while I figured out how it works.



# Seed DropPer
The seed dropper was my first project of the year. I chose this project because it inly involved working in solidworks. The seed dropper would go to the gardening teacher once it was done. They were going to use it in garden for seeding the trays. Here is the way it [works](https://youtu.be/MTVvjtp3V8E)

### Lesson Learned
By doing this project I learned a lot about different topics and aspects in Engineering, designig, and sketching, but most of all I learned a lot of SolidWorks skills.



# Design Tables
In this assignment we were assigned to do make a shape with different sizes using the configuration. The instructions were pretty simple. Although I had some issues, but they weren't as big. I had a little hard time with the configurations because not all of the configurations had recieved the right measure, so there were some erros that I had to fix in order to make it work properley. I had to open the specefic configuration and do the measuerments there. Once I did that it worked very fine.

### Lessons Learned 
In this assignment I learned two new skill which are really helpfull. I learned how to use Wizard Hole and to creat a confiquration. The Wizard Hole can be really helpful for extruding holes in the middle of a circle and the configuration can save you a lot of time and effort. Instead of making a whole new part you can make a bunch of them in no time with a couple supper easy steps. 


# Advance and Mechanical Mates
In this assignment we had to make a spool shape. We had to create three different sizes of the spool shape. We had to put them together in an assembley using mates.

### Lessons Learned
This assignment assignment I learned how to use advanced mates. I had difficult time find the peroper mates and applying it to the right part, but I figured it out. It was alos a really good review of the configurations.
