## A little practice
  
In this assignment, we were supposed to follow a tutorial provided by SolidWorks itself and have different parts done. One part included an assembly and part and the second one just included just one part.

### Lessons Learned
These were the first assignments of the year so kind of refreshed everything in my memory and the new skill I learned by doing this assignment was how to use Linear Pattern. It basically allows you to copy your drawn sketch multiple times in a specific pattern.



## Sweeps and Lofts

This assignment includes using lofted cuts, revolves and sweeps. We were to sketch a hammerhead and we had the choice to make a handle for it or not. Same as the last assignment we used a tutorial that's in SolidWorks.

### Lessons Learned
I learned how to use lofted cuts, revolves and sweeps by doing this assignment. I had trouble with the Flex, but after playing with it for a while I figured out how it works.
