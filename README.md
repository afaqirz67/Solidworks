## A little practice
  
In this assignment, we were supposed to follow a tutorial provided by SolidWorks itself and have different parts done. One part included an assembly and part and the second one just included just one part.

### Lessons Learned
These were the first assignments of the year so kind of refreshed everything in my memory and the new skill I learned by doing this assignment was how to use Linear Pattern. It basically allows you to copy your drawn sketch multiple times in a specific pattern.



## Sweeps and Lofts

This assignment includes using lofted cuts, revolves and sweeps. We were to sketch a hammerhead and we had the choice to make a handle for it or not. Same as the last assignment we used a tutorial that's in SolidWorks.

### Lessons Learned
I learned how to use lofted cuts, revolves and sweeps by doing this assignment. I had trouble with the Flex, but after playing with it for a while I figured out how it works.



# Seed DropPer
The seed dropper was my first project of the year. I chose this project because it inly involved working in solidworks. The seed dropper would go to the gardening teacher once it was done. They were going to use it in garden for seeding the trays. Here is the way it [works](https://youtu.be/MTVvjtp3V8E)

### Lesson Learned
By doing this project I learned a lot about different topics and aspects in Engineering, designig, and sketching, but most of all I learned a lot of SolidWorks skills.
